There are many great README templates available on GitHub, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Sections:
* Zen Board
* Standup
* Matrix Board
* Plan Ahead

Features:
* Promodoro
* Heisenhower Matrix
* Standup

.
